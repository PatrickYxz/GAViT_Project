# Debugging

> **WARNING:** This guide assumes that you have already [logged in to a login

## Running IDE as Text Editor

To run your IDE (e.g., PyCharm, VSCode) on the login node, simply enter your
credentials using the remote SSH functionality of your IDE.

When you need to run your script with GPU, you may run Slurm in your IDE's
terminal to start a job. More information on how to use `srun` and `sbatch` can
be found in the [Slurm guide](slurm.md).

> Note: You should avoid running too many extensions as there is a RAM limit
> enforced on login nodes that may cause your IDE to be killed due to Out of
> Memory. Ensure you exit your IDEs properly as we have been informed that some
> users run into issues when they do not do so and two instances of their IDE
> run simultaneously.

Please take note of the following:

1. Each and every user has a CPU and memory limit on the each login node.
2. IDEs beyond VSCode and PyCharm can be more hungry on CPU and memory. This
   means either it initialize very slow, or it directly triggers OOM-killer.
3. Most IDEs deploy a backend process on the login node so you can edit your
   code in real time. This also means this backend eats up your memory quota.
   Backends not closed gracefully can stay in the memory and eat your memory
   quota as well.
4. If you have any enquiries regarding IDEs, please come to the office hour
   instead of sending emails. We regret to say that we are unable to debug such
   issues easily without being able to reproduce ourselves.

## Running IDE on Compute Node to Debug

> **IMPORTANT NOTE:** This guide should only be used if you specifically need
> to be on the compute node running your processes. Following these steps will
> hog up resources until you close your terminal.
> **You are recommended to [run only your script](slurm.md) most of the time.**

We are fully aware that users might want to run debugging sessions, either
checking outputs in shell sessions or running a Python debugger and debug your
code line-by-line.

To debug directly on the cluster using IDEs (e.g., PyCharm, VSCode), set up an
**SSH tunnel**. This tunnel runs on the **login node** and relays traffic to a
GPU node, allowing you to “directly” interact with it.

> 💡 **Tip:** If you're unfamiliar with configuring remote connections in
> PyCharm or VSCode, refer to their official documentation.

### Step-by-Step Instructions

1. **Allocate a GPU node** with the resources you need:

    ```bash
    salloc <resource_request>
    ```
    - **Example:**
      ```bash
      salloc --gpus=v100:1 --time=0:30:00
      ```
    - This starts a shell. **Do not exit this shell** — it will cancel the job.

2. **Open a new terminal window.**

3. **SSH into your allocated GPU node.**

    1. Via SSH command (VSCode)

        This is the command to provide your IDE if you want to use an IDE.
        If you are a PyCharm user

        ```bash
        ssh -J <username>@<login_node_ip> <username>@<allocated_node_name>
        ```

        - **Example:**
          ```bash
          ssh -J user@0.0.0.0 user@gpu-example-1
          ```

        This tells SSH to go through the login node (`-J`) and connect directly
        to the compute node.

    2. Create an SSH tunnel (PyCharm)

        For IDEs where you are unable to customize the SSH command, please see
        below.

        Run the following command on **your** computer's terminal (NOT any
        terminals that already has SSH running).

        ```bash
        ssh -L <port>:<allocated_node_name>:22 <username>@<login_node_ip>
        ```

        This will start an SSH session. Do not close this shell either. This SSH
        session maps a local port on your computer to the SSH port on your
        allocated node. In this way, you can put `localhost:<port>` instead in
        your IDE as your remote host, i.e., your IDE is connecting to this local
        port, which is being forwarded to the allocated node. This forwarding
        process is transparent to your IDE.

## My IDE doesn't want to connect.

We have a section dedicated to IDEs in the [FAQ here](troubleshooting.md#IDE).

## After You're Done

- **Close all terminals and SSH sessions properly.**
- **⚠️ Do not leave SSH sessions hanging or unattended.**
    **This will cause your priority to become lower** AND other users to be
    unable to use the resources you are using.
