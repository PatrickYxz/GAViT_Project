# Using Conda on the Cluster (with Lmod)

Our cluster uses **Lmod** for managing software environments.

If you want to use Python packages via **Miniforge3** or **Miniconda3**, you
must follow these steps.

---

## Load Miniforge3 or Miniconda3

First, check what modules are available:

```bash
module avail
```

Then load either Miniforge3 or Miniconda3 via

```bash
module load Miniforge3
```

Do not load both at the same time.

You *HAVE TO* run
```bash
source activate
```

to activate the base environment or

```bash
source activate env_name
```

to directly start a certain environment.

## Create your environment if you want custom packages

You *HAVE TO* create your own conda environment if you want to install packages
with `pip install` or `conda install`.

By default, you *CANNOT* install anything to the base environment because it is
supposed to be a shared python env for basic python operations.

The command to create your env is `conda create -n env_name python=3.xx`, and
*DO NOT* forget to activate it by `conda activate env_name`. `env_name` is the
name you define! You also need to specify specific python version you want, for
example, 3.10.

## Scope of Support

As a reminder of the [Usage Guidelines](guideline.md), we do not and will not
help you to resolve problems that are not caused by the cluster's setups, such
as package conflicts and package version mismatch.

We provide a guide on
[how to start debugging your code on the cluster](debugging.md), BUT we do not
help you debug any of your applications' specific errors.

Before asking for help, take a close look at your error message and Google it or
ask GPT. This is to save both your and our time on trivial questions. If that
fails, check our [troubleshooting guide](troubleshooting.md).
